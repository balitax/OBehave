/**
 *    A Behavior is a unit of code that does a single job that may be reused in multiple areas of a project or projects.
 *
 *    Using composition, View Controllers are given ownership of a Behavior in Interface Builder (or the storyboard).
 *    Composition is favoured over inheriting functionality from a base view controller for the following reasons:
 *
 *    1.  Behaviors can be re-used across multiple projects
 *    2.  A base View Controller with lots of code that may be used by some
 *        but not all subclassed view controllers is poor design.
 *    3.  Using Behaviors provides true separation of concerns.
 *    4.  View Controllers are reduced in size
 *
 *    See http://www.objc.io/issue-13/behaviors.html for details.
 *
 *    Additionally, in this library a Behavior can have a data source, a delegate and an effect
 *    object, each of which can add individual and specific functionality to the Behavior which 
 *    will help customise a Behavior as it's used per instance.
 *
 *    For instance, in a Behavior that displays an action sheet, the text displayed in the sheet
 *    can be customised by a data source, while the functionality of the Behavior is unchanged
